# Identify points in an image:
Java project - Data structures and algorithms course

This project was done as part of the “Data structures and algorithms”.
the aim of the project is to Implement data structures in Java include AVL trees, Hash table, LinkedList and so.
The main themes of this project are data structures implementations.
This project is including 6 classes:

AVL-node: this class is the most basic part of the code, each AVL node instance carries Generic data <T>.

AVL: a generic data (nodes data is generic <T>) binary tree.
this DS is special because it keeps balancing. this uniqe quallity make the search time in such BST on O(log n). 

Hash Table: hash table holds a point data (chaining hash table- Open hashing concept).

Object with coordinates: a point data generic object.
  
(Point) Linked-list: linked list holeds point(_x,_y) data.
  
  Student solution: aggregates the classes and interfaces.
