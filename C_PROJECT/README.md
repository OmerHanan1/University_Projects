# Pokemon's Project
 C project - Advanced programming course

This project was done as part of the “Advanced programming course”.
the aim of the project is to create and use structs, pointers (include function pointers to data-sigment), memory allocations and memory leaks.
This project is a preparation to the next project (C_SECOND_PROJECT).
This project is about building a "Pokedex" and including modules such as:

Defs.h: definitions header.

Pokemon.h: pokemon module interface.

Pokemon.c: pokemon module imp.

MainFirst.c: the main file for this project (first). this file includes 3 main functions:
  1. Pokedex builder - initializing the data structures from the given text file.
  2. Main - related manu.
  3. Deletion - deleting all memory allocations to prevent memory leaks.

### The code was checked with Valgrind memory leaks checker - memory leaks free code.
