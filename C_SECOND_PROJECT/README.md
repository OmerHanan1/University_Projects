 Python project - Introduction to computer science course

This project was done as part of the “Introduction to computer science (in Python programming language)”.
the aim of the project is to perform derivatives and integrals for defined polynomials and to represent the results in an accurate mathematical way to the user.
The main themes of this project are operator overriding, object-oriented programming.
This project is including 4 classes:
Monom: this class is the most basic part of the code, each Monom instance carries (Power, coefficient).

Polynomial: a chain of Monoms connecting together representing a mathematical polynomial.

Note: Monom class and polynomial class supporting compare functions.

Binary tree node: holed a polynomial.

Polynomial Binary tree: a Binary search tree of polynomials, since all the polynomials have comparison functions, an insertion to this binary tree will keep it sorted.
